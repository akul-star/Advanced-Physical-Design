# Advanced-Physical-Design
--------------------------

"Advanced Physical Design" represents an intricate domain within digital integrated circuit engineering. It entails the intricate process of transforming a high-level logical description of an electronic circuit into a meticulously optimized layout, considering performance, power efficiency, and area utilization. OpenLANE, an open-source ASIC design flow, combined with the Sky130 Process Design Kit (PDK), has become a powerful toolkit for realizing this goal. Starting with RTL design, the process encompasses synthesis, floor planning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, physical verification, and timing closure. Advanced physical design goes a step further, incorporating sophisticated techniques such as custom library cell design and power network optimization. These tools and methodologies have empowered engineers and researchers to explore cutting-edge semiconductor design, enabling innovation in the development of complex integrated circuits.
